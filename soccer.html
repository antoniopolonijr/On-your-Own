    <p>Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, played and watched by millions of people<br> across various cultures and continents. It promotes camaraderie, competition, and passion<br> among players and fans alike.</p>
    <p>I play soccer at least 2 times a week with my friends. Playing soccer makes me <em>happier!</em> <br>
